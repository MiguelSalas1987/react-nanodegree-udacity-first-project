##What is this about?
This is my submission for the first project of the [udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) [React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). This training program has been developed in conjuction with [React Training](https://reacttraining.com).
They have provided an [stater template repository](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) to begin with the project that I encourage you to refer to that to get more information about the scope of this assessment. 

For you to have an idea, they have provided the markup, styles and an API as a backend for the app, but without any dynamic behavior. For accomplishing that nice dynamic behavior that we all love, they have also provided a series of requirements to make it all work as single page app using [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router). 

##What this should do?
The project consist in two views. The main view is about categorized bookshelves
in which you can move each book from one shelf to another by selecting a shelf in the dropdown select of each book.
The search view is about searching for books calling the API, you can then select among these books to add to one of your shelves in the main view by using the dropdown select of each book. Also, books that are already in one of your bookshelves should indicate to which shelf they belong to in this same dropdown select, by having a selected option.
Books added in the search view are immediately present in the shelf selected, so you can see them in the main view.

##What can you search for in the search view?

The search view is limited to a fixed set of terms supported by the API provided in the starter template repository, you can see that set [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md).

##What do you need to run the app?
You must at least have node and npm installed in your machine, which you can get [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

##Do you know how to use git?
First of all, do you have git installed in your machine? As long as I know it comes preinstalled in any linux distro and also for mac, so you don't need to install it for those. If you are using other operative system go here to get [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) so you can clone the repo.

##Do you know how to clone a repo?
Go [here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) to know how if you don't.

## installation
Simply go to the root directory of the cloned repo (using the terminal) and run this :
```
npm install
```
## starting the app
After installation is completed (while you are in the root directory of the cloned repo) start the app by running this command in the terminal:
```
npm run start
```
This will start the app in your browser.

##create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

##Thanks for your time! 
As some friends always say: _Don't forget to be awesome!_
